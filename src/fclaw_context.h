/**
 * @file
 * 
 * @brief This file contains the declaration of the fclaw_context_t structure and related functions.
 * 
 * The fclaw_context_t structure represents a context for functions that can be paused and resumed.
 * It provides functions to retrieve and save values to the context object.
 * 
 * Example usage:
 * 
 * // Get the context object from the global context
 * fclaw_context_t *context = fclaw_context_get(glob, "my_context");
 * 
 * // Get an integer value from the context object
 * int value;
 * fclaw_context_get_int(context, "my_value", &value, 10);
 * 
 * // Get a double value from the context object
 * double value;
 * fclaw_context_get_double(context, "my_value", &value, 3.14);
 * 
 * // Save values to the context object
 * // This should be called right before exit points in a function
 * fclaw_context_save(context);
 *
 * This is designed with some restrictions in mind:
 * - The context object shoulde be retrieved at the beginning of a function with fclaw_context_get.
 * - The values should be retrieved with fclaw_context_get_int or fclaw_context_get_double.
 *    - These should be called in the same manner every time the resumable function is called.
 *    - If these arent called in the same manner, the program will abort.
 * - The values should be saved with fclaw_context_save right before exit points in the function.
 *    - the save call will save all the variables pointed to in the get_double/int calls.
 *
 *
